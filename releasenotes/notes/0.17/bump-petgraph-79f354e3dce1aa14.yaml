    The version of petgraph used in ``rustworkx-core`` has been bumped to
    0.8.1 from 0.7.1. This means for users of ``rustworkx-core`` that are
    passing graph objects built using petgraph to algorithm functions you need
    to ensure you upgrade your petgraph usage accordingly. This is handled
    correctly if you use the petgraph re-export from ``rustworkx_core::petgraph``.
    Any API changes around the usage of petgraph will need to be reflected in
    the upgrade of your usage however. Refer to the release documentation for
    petgraph 0.8.0 for details.
