    Fixed an issue with the custom sequence return types,
    :class:`~.BFSSuccessors`, :class:`~.NodeIndices`, :class:`~.EdgeList`,
    :class:`~.WeightedEdgeList`, :class:`~.EdgeIndices`, and :class:`~.Chains`
    where they previously were missing certain attributes that prevented them
    being used as a sequence for certain built-in functions such as
    ``reversed()``.
    Fixed `#696 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/696>`__.
