  abstract = {Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and efficient systems.
  It is designed to support concurrency and parallelism in building applications and
  libraries that take full advantage of modern hardware. Rust's static type system is
  safe1 and expressive and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency,
  and memory safety.Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to
  predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this
  is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support
  for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls
  with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee
  the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized
  or deallocated memory.},

  abstract = {Large networks are becoming a widely used abstraction for studying complex systems
  in a broad set of disciplines, ranging from social-network analysis to molecular biology
  and neuroscience. Despite an increasing need to analyze and manipulate large networks,
  only a limited number of tools are available for this task.Here, we describe the Stanford
  Network Analysis Platform (SNAP), a general-purpose, high-performance system that
  provides easy-to-use, high-level operations for analysis and manipulation of large
  networks. We present SNAP functionality, describe its implementational details, and
  give performance benchmarks. SNAP has been developed for single big-memory machines,
  and it balances the trade-off between maximum performance, compact in-memory graph
  representation, and the ability to handle dynamic graphs in which nodes and edges
  are being added or removed over time. SNAP can process massive networks with hundreds
  of millions of nodes and billions of edges. SNAP offers over 140 different graph algorithms
  that can efficiently manipulate large graphs, calculate structural properties, generate
  regular and random graphs, and handle attributes and metadata on nodes and edges.
  Besides being able to handle large graphs, an additional strength of SNAP is that
  networks and their attributes are fully dynamic; they can be modified during the computation
  at low cost. SNAP is provided as an open-source library in C++ as well as a module
  in Python.We also describe the Stanford Large Network Dataset, a set of social and
  information real-world networks and datasets, which we make publicly available. The
  collection is a complementary resource to our SNAP software and is widely used for
  development and benchmarking of graph analytics algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a largely improved version of the VF2 algorithm for the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem. The improvements are twofold. Firstly, it is based on a new approach for determining the matching order of the nodes, and secondly, more efficient — nevertheless easier to compute — cutting rules are proposed. They together reduce the search space significantly. In addition to the usual Subgraph Isomorphism Problem, the paper also presents specialized algorithms for the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism and for the Graph Isomorphism Problems. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided using a wide range of inputs, including both real-life biological and chemical datasets and standard randomly generated graph series. The results show major and consistent running time improvements over the other known methods. The C++ implementations of the algorithms are available open-source as part of the LEMON graph and network optimization library.}

abstract = {Algorithms for finding shortest paths are presented which are faster than algorithms
previously known on networks which are relatively sparse in arcs. Known results which
the results of this paper extend are surveyed briefly and analyzed. A new implementation
for priority queues is employed, and a class of “arc set partition” algorithms is
introduced. For the single source problem on networks with nonnegative arcs a running
time of O(min(n1+1/k + e, n + e) log n)) is achieved, where there are n nodes and
e arcs, and k is a fixed integer satisfying k > 0. This bound is O(e) on dense networks.
For the single source and all pairs problem on unrestricted networks the running time
is O(min(n2+1/k + ne, n2 log n + ne log n).},
