prelude: >
  A new module ``graph_ext`` has been introduced which provides traits
  that extend ``petgraph`` data structures with additional methods when
  imported.
features:
  - |
    Node contraction is now supported for ``petgraph`` types ``StableGraph``
    and ``GraphMap`` in rustworkx-core. To use it, import one of the ``ContractNodes*`` traits
    from ``graph_ext`` and call the ``contract_nodes`` method on your graph.
  - |
    All current ``petgraph`` data structures now support testing for parallel
    edges in ``rustworkx-core``. To use this, import ``HasParallelEdgesDirected``
    or ``HasParallelEdgesUndirected`` depending on your graph type, and call
    the ``has_parallel_edges`` method on your graph.
  - |
    A new trait ``NodeRemovable`` has been added to ``graph_ext`` module in
    ``rustworkx-core`` which provides a consistent interface for performing
    node removal operations on ``petgraph`` types ``Graph``, ``StableGraph``,
    ``GraphMap``, and ``MatrixGraph``. To use it, import ``NodeRemovable`` from
    ``graph_ext``.
