    Added support for reading and writing matrices in the Matrix Market (MM) format via the new
    :func:`~rustworkx.read_matrix_market`, :func:`~rustworkx.read_matrix_market_file`,
    and :func:`~rustworkx.write_matrix_market` functions.
    These functions enable importing and exporting sparse matrices in COO (Coordinate) format, either from
    a file or directly from an in-memory string.
