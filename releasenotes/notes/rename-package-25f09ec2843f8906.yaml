    The ``retworkx`` package has been renamed to ``rustworkx``. This was done
    out of respect for a request from the maintainers of the NetworkX library.
    For the time being the ``retworkx`` name will continue to work, however
    any package requirements or imports using ``retworkx`` should be renamed
    to ``rustworkx``.
