    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~retworkx.generators.binomial_tree_graph`
    and :func:`~retworkx.generators.directed_binomial_tree_graph` generator
    functions in :mod:`retworkx.generators` where passing an ``order`` value
    ``>= 60`` would cause an overflow and raise a ``PanicException`` caused by
    the internal Rust panic when overflowing or exceeding the max Vec size.
    Instead the function will raise an ``OverflowError`` and indicate the
    specified order is too large.
    Fixed `#457 <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/issues/457?>`__
