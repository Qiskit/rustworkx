    A new kwarg, ``multigraph`` was added to the :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph`
    generator functions:

     * :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_cycle_graph`
     * :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_path_graph`
     * :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_star_graph`
     * :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_mesh_graph`
     * :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_grid_graph`

    This can be used to set whether the generated
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` objects are multi graphs or not (to set
    whether parallel edges can be added or not). By default this is set to
    ``True``.
