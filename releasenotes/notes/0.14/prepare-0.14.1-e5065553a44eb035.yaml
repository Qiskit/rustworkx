  The rustworkx 0.14.1 release is a small bug fix release that fixes two issues,
  firstly it address a performance regression that was introduced in 0.12.0
  for accessing items of custom sequence return types such as
  :class:`.NodeIndices`. Secondly, it fixes a build configuration issue for
  Linux ppc64le with Python 3.12 and 3.8 which prevented publishing wheels in
  0.14.0.

    Fixed an performance issue with the custom sequence return type classes'
    ``__getitem__`` method (used for element access and iteration). When support
    for slice access was added to these classes in rustworkx 0.12.0 this was
    previously implemented in a way that added unnecessary overhead to index
    based access, which has been corrected. This fix applies to ``__getitem__``
    on:

      * :class:`.BFSSuccessors`
      * :class:`.BFSPredecessors`
      * :class:`.NodeIndices`
      * :class:`.EdgeIndices`
      * :class:`.EdgeList`
      * :class:`.WeightedEdgeList`
      * :class:`.Chains`

    details.
