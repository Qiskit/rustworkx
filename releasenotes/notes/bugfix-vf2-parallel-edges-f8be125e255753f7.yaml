    Fixes the output of :func:`~retworkx.is_subgraph_isomorphic`
    if the input graphs have parallel edges.

    Fixes the output of :func:`~retworkx.is_isomorphic`
    if the input graphs have parallel edges and an `edge_matcher`
    is specified.

    as the number of edges in the graph rather than building the
    full adjacency matrix.
