features:
  - |
    Added a function ``~rustworkx_core.dag_algo::layers`` in rustworkx-core to 
    get the layers of a directed acyclic graph.  This is equivalent to the
    :func:`.layers` function that existed in the Python API but now exposes it
    for Rust users too.
fix:
  - |
    When calling ``~rustworkx_core.dag_algo::layers``if the provided graph has
    a cycle, the function will throw a ``DAGHasCycle`` error instance.
