    Added a new function, :func:`~.graph_misra_gries_edge_color` to color edges
    of a :class:`~.PyGraph` object using the Misra-Gries edge coloring algorithm.
    
    The above algorithm is described in the paper paper: "A constructive proof of 
    Vizing's theorem" by Misra and Gries, 1992.
    
    The coloring produces at most d + 1 colors where d is the maximum degree
    of the graph.
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        import rustworkx as rx
    
        graph = rx.generators.cycle_graph(7)
        edge_colors = rx.graph_misra_gries_edge_color(graph)
        assert edge_colors == {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}
