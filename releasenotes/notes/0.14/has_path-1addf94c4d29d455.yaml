    Added :func:`~rustworkx.has_path` which accepts as arguments a :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` or :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and checks if there is a path from source to destination

    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        from rustworkx import PyDiGraph, has_path

        graph = PyDiGraph()
        a = graph.add_node("A")
        b = graph.add_node("B")
        c = graph.add_node("C")
        edge_list = [(a, b, 1), (b, c, 1)]
        graph.add_edges_from(edge_list)

        path_exists = has_path(graph, a, c)
        assert(path_exists == True)

        path_exists = has_path(graph, c, a)
        assert(path_exists == False)
