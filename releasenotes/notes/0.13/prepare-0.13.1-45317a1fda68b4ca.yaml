    rustworkx 0.13.1 is a bugfix release, addressing some issues identified
    since the 0.13.0 release.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a potential source of non-determinism in the output of the
    ``token_swapper()`` function in rustworkx-core along with its matching
    function in the Python rustworkx package: :func:`~.graph_token_swapper`.
  - |
    Fixed the rustworkx-core dependencies to loosen the constraints on the
    version of ``hashbrown`` and ``indexmap`` used. Previously, they were fixed
    to the latest version which was compatible with rustworkx's MSRV. This has
    been updated so a range of versions can be used, which will enable users
    that don't have as restrictive of an MSRV to use newer versions of these
    libraries with rustworkx-core.
issues:
  - |
    The type hint stub files included in this release (and 0.13.0) are not
    compatible with Python 3.7's type hinting syntax. If you are now using
    ``mypy`` to partially validate the typing in your usage of rustworkx, you
    should not run this with Python 3.7 as it will not function correctly.
    The actual rustworkx code will continue to function as expected with
    Python 3.7 for the 0.13.x release series, it was just the typing syntax
    used in the stubs files which are incompatible with Python 3.7.
