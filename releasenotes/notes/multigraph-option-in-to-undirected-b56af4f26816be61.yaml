    Two new kwargs, ``multigraph`` and ``weight_combo_fn``, was added to
    :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.to_undirected`. This can be used to set
    whether the generated :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` object is a multi graph or not
    (whether parallel edges can be added or not). By default this is set to ``True``.
    If set to ``False`` an extra python callable object should be specified to combine
    the weights/data of parallel edges.
