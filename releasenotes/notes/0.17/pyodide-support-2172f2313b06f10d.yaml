    `rustworkx` now has experimental support for `Pyodide <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/>`__.
    Pyodide is a Python distribution for WebAssembly that runs in the browser.
    This is the first release that compiles with Pyodide and will allow users to run `rustworkx`
    in web applications. Because Pyodide wheels are not available in PyPI,
    we are working with the Pyodide team to publish them in the Pyodide package index.
