features:
  - |
    A new module, :mod:`rustworkx.visualization` has been added. This module
    will contain various functions used for visualizing rustworkx graphs.
  - |
    A new visualization function, :func:`rustworkx.visualization.mpl_drawer`,
    for visualizing graphs with `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ has
    been added. This function requires that matplotlib, which is not a
    dependency of rustworkx, to be installed. To install matplotlib you can
    either use ``pip install matplotlib`` or when you install rustworkx
    ``pip install 'rustworkx[mpl]'``. This function can take any rustworkx
    graph object, a :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` or :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph`
    and visualize them with various options to tweak the output. For example,
    a basic graph without any labels is:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.generators.grid_graph(4, 6)
      mpl_draw(graph)

    or to change the colors:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.generators.grid_graph(4, 6)
      mpl_draw(graph, node_color='r', edge_color='#00FFFF')

    Refer to the function documentation for a full list of options.
