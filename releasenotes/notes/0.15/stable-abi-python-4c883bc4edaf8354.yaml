    rustworkx wheels are now built against Python's stable
    Application Binary Interface (ABI). For rustworkx users, this means
    that wheels distributed by us via PyPI will continue to work with
    newer versions of Python without having to recompile the code.
    This change will also simplify the release process for the developers
    and reduce the storage size required to mirror rustworkx wheels.
