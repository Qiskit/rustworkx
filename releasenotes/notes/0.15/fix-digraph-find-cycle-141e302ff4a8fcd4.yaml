fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the behavior of :func:`~rustworkx.digraph_find_cycle` when
    no source node was provided. Previously, the function would start looking
    for a cycle at an arbitrary node which was not guaranteed to return a cycle.
    Now, the function will smartly choose a source node to start the search from
    such that if a cycle exists, it will be found.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``rustworkx-core`` function ``rustworkx_core::connectivity::find_cycle``
    now requires the ``petgraph::visit::Visitable`` trait for its input
    argument ``graph``. This was required to fix the behavior when ``source``
    is ``None`` to ensure we always find a cycle if one exists.
