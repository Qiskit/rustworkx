features:

    The :func:`~.closeness_centrality` method is now parallel for better performance.
    The parallelism is toggled via the new `parallel_threshold` optional parameter.
upgrade:
  - |
    The `closeness_centrality` function in `rustworkx-core`
    now requires `parallel_threshold` parameter which controls when the
    algorithm switches to parallel execution. This is a breaking change.
