    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.num_shortest_paths_unweighted`
    (and it's per type variants
    :func:`~rustworkx.digraph_num_shortest_paths_unweighted` and
    :func:`~rustworkx.graph_num_shortest_paths_unweighted`), which is used to
    get a count of unweighted shortest paths from a given node to all other
    nodes (where path exists) in the graph.
