  This is a new Rustworkx release with many bug fixes and new features to
  the library. The highlights of this release are:

    * Enhanced support for type checking with `mypy` and `pyright`
    * Support for reading GraphML files that are compressed
    * New dominance algorithms

  This release uses the `Python Stable ABI <https://docs.python.org/3.9/c-api/stable.html>`__,
  and will be compatible with all versions from Python 3.9 onwards. The published
  binaries have been tested with Python 3.9 to 3.13, although they will likely
  work with future versions like 3.14.
  We'd like to thank all the users that reported issues and contributed to this release.
  This is the rustworkx release with the most individual contributors to date!
