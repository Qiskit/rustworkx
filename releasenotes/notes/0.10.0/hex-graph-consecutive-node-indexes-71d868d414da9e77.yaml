    Previously, the graphs created by :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_hexagonal_lattice_graph`
    and :func:`retworkx.generators.hexagonal_lattice_graph` contained holes in the node indices.
    This has been fixed by generating graphs with consecutive node indexes.
    Fixed `#373 <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/issues/373>`__
