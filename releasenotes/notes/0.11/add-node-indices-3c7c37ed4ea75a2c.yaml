    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indices`, to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes.
    This method is identical to the previously existing
    :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indexes` method but changes the name
    to be consistent with the use of "indices" throughout the rest of
    retworkx. The :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indexes` will likely
    be deprecated in a future release prior to it's removal in an eventual
    1.0 release.
