    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.has_parallel_edges`, to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph`
    (:meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.has_parallel_edges`) classes. This method returns
    ``True`` if there are parallel edges in the graph and ``False`` otherwise.
