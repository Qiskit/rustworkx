    The :func:`~retworkx.adjacency_matrix` function has a new kwarg
    ``null_value`` which is used to adjust the value used in the output matrix
    representing the absence of an edge. This can be set to any float value and
    if not specified the default value of 0.0 is still used. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import numpy as np
      import retworkx

      graph = retworkx.generators.cycle_graph(25)
      distance_matrix = retworkx.adjacency_matrix(graph, null_value=np.inf)
      print(distance_matrix)

    The :func:`~retworkx.distance_matrix` function has a new kwarg
    ``null_value`` which is used to adjust the value used in the output matrix
    representing the absence of a path. This can be set to any float value and
    if not specified the default value of 0.0 is still used. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import numpy as np
      import retworkx

      graph = retworkx.generators.cycle_graph(25)
      distance_matrix = retworkx.distance_matrix(graph, null_value=np.inf)
      print(distance_matrix)
