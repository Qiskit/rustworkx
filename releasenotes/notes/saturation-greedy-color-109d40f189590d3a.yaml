features:
  - Added a new class :class:`~.ColoringStrategy` used to specify the strategy used by 
    the greedy node and edge coloring algorithms. 
    The ``Degree`` strategy colors the nodes with higher degree first.
    The ``Saturation`` strategy dynamically chooses the vertex that has the largest 
    number of different colors already assigned to its neighbors, and, in case of a tie, 
    the vertex that has the largest number of uncolored neighbors.
    The ``IndependentSet`` strategy finds independent subsets of the graph, and assigns 
    a different color to each of these subsets.
  - |
    Added a new keyword argument, ``strategy``, to :func:`.graph_greedy_color`
    and to :func:`.graph_greedy_edge_color` to specify the greedy coloring strategy.
    
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

        graph = rx.generators.generalized_petersen_graph(5, 2)

        coloring = rx.graph_greedy_color(graph, strategy=rx.ColoringStrategy.Saturation)
        colors = [coloring[node] for node in graph.node_indices()]

        layout = rx.shell_layout(graph, nlist=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],[6, 7, 8, 9, 5]])
        mpl_draw(graph, node_color=colors, pos=layout)
  - |
    Added a new keyword argument, ``preset_color_fn``, to :func:`.graph_greedy_edge_color`
    which is used to provide preset colors for specific edges when computing the graph
    coloring. You can optionally pass a callable to that argument which will
    be passed edge index from the graph and is either expected to return an
    integer color to use for that edge, or `None` to indicate there is no
    preset color for that edge. For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw
    
        graph = rx.generators.generalized_petersen_graph(5, 2)
    
        def preset_colors(edge_index):
            if edge_index == 0:
                return 3
    
        coloring = rx.graph_greedy_edge_color(graph, preset_color_fn=preset_colors)
        colors = [coloring[edge] for edge in graph.edge_indices()]
        
        layout = rx.shell_layout(graph, nlist=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8, 9, 5]])
        mpl_draw(graph, edge_color=colors, pos=layout)
