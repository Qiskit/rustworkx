"""graph6 format helpers.

This module provides a namespace for working with undirected graph6 strings
as described in: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt

It wraps the low-level functions exported from the compiled extension
(`read_graph6_str`, `write_graph6_from_pygraph`) and offers convenience
helpers. Backwards compatibility: existing top-level functions in
`rustworkx` remain valid; this is a thin faÃ§ade only.
