features:
  - |
    Two new return types :class:`~rustworkx.PathMapping` and
    :class:`~rustworkx.PathLengthMapping`. These classes are returned from
    functions that previously returned a dictionary of paths or a dictionary
    of path lengths. They both implement the Python mapping protocol and can
    be used inplace as a read-only dict.

    The functions:

    * :func:`rustworkx.digraph_k_shortest_path_lengths`
    * :func:`rustworkx.graph_k_shortest_path_lengths`
    * :func:`rustworkx.k_shortest_path_lengths`
    * :func:`rustworkx.digraph_dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths`
    * :func:`rustworkx.graph_dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths`
    * :func:`rustworkx.dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths`

    no longer are returning a ``dict`` and instead are returning
    :class:`rustworkx.PathLengthMapping` objects. This new return type
    is much faster to build and it implements the python mapping protocol in a
    read-only fashion and should not be noticeable unless explicit type
    checking or mutating the result were done.
