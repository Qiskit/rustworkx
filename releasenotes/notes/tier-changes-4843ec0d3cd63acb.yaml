    There have been changes to the support tiers for some platforms. These changes
    reflect the current state of supporting each of the underlying platforms.

    * Linux for aarch64 has been upgraded to tier 1, and will now be built and tested
       as part of upstream development on every commit.
    * Linux for x86_64 (musl) and aarch64 (musl) have been upgraded to tier 2, and
       will be built and tested as part of the release process. NumPy also provides
       wheels for these platforms, so we expect most users to install from PyPI with
       little effort.
    * Linux for ppc64le has been downgraded to tier 4. We will still publish wheels for
       this platform, but they will not be tested. This is due to limitations in the CI infrastructure available and
       our inability to reliably test the platform.
    * Linux for i686 has been downgraded to tier 4. We will still publish wheels for this
       platform, but they will not be tested as NumPy no longer provides i686 wheels. Users
       will need a C/C++ compiler to install rustworkx on these platforms due to our dependency
       on NumPy.
    * Windows 32-bits has been downgraded to tier 4. Although NumPy publishes win32 wheels,
       the support of `rust-numpy <https://github.com/PyO3/rust-numpy>`__ for win32 is precarious and might be dropped at any time.
       If possible, we recommend using the 64-bit version of Python on Windows where we have tier 1 support.
