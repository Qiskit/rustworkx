    The :func:`~retworkx.unweighted_average_shortest_path_length` function
    has a new kwarg ``disconnected``. When ``disconnected`` is set to ``True``
    the output value calculated by the function will only account for connected
    node pairs.

    The default behavior for how the
    :func:`~retworkx.unweighted_average_shortest_path_length` function handles
    disconnected graphs has been changed Previously, disconnected pairs of nodes
    was assumed to have zero distance which is arguably incorrect/unexpected
    behavior. To make this more consistent with user expectations this has been
    changed to an infinite value. In addition, an extra kwarg ``disconnected``
    was added where, if set to ``True``, the average is taken only over connected
    node pairs. By default, it's set to ``False``. If the previous behavior of
    treating disconnected pairs of nodes as have a distance of zero is desired,
    it can be reproduced using the rest of retworkx API like:

    .. code-block:: python

        import retworkx

        graph = retworkx.undirected_gnm_random_graph(20, 10, seed=42)
        n = len(graph)
        d_mat = retworkx.distance_matrix(graph, null_value=0.0)
        avg_shortest_path = d_mat.sum() / (n * (n - 1.0))
