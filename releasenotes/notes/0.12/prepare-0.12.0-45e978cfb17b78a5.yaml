  This release introduces some major changes to the Rustworkx (formerly
  retworkx) project. The first change is the library has been renamed from
  retworkx to rustworkx, and the retworkx-core rust crate has been renamed
  rustworkx-core. This was done out of respect for a request from the
  maintainers of the NetworkX library. For the current release the retworkx
  library will still continue to work as it has without any notification,
  but starting in the 0.13.0 release a ``DeprecationWarning`` will be emitted
  when importing from retworkx and in the 1.0.0 release we will drop support
  for the legacy name. For the retworkx-core crate, there will no longer be
  any releases under that name on crates.io and all future versions of the
  library will be released as rustworkx-core.

  Additionally this release adds support for Python 3.11 and also moves to
  manylinux2014 for all precompiled Linux binaries we publish to PyPI. The
  minimum supported Rust version for building rustworkx from source has
  increased to Rust 1.48.

  This release also includes several new features, some highlights are:

    * Support for graph attributes under the ``attrs`` attribute
    * New serialization format support (a graphml parser, :func:`~.read_graphml`,
      and a node link JSON generator, :func:`~.node_link_json`)
    * New algorithms functions including:
        * Eigenvector Centrality
        * Stoerâ€“Wagner Min-Cut algorithm
        * Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm
