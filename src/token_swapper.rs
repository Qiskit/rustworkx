/// This module performs an approximately optimal Token Swapping algorithm
/// Supports partial mappings (i.e. not-permutations) for graphs with missing tokens.
///
/// Based on the paper: Approximation and Hardness for Token Swapping by Miltzow et al. (2016)
/// ArXiV: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05150
///
/// The inputs are a partial ``mapping`` to be implemented in swaps, and the number of ``trials``
/// to perform the mapping. It's minimized over the trials.
///
/// It returns a list of tuples representing the swaps to perform.
///
/// :param PyGraph graph: The input graph
/// :param dict[int: int] mapping: Map of (node, token)
/// :param int trials: The number of trials to run
/// :param int seed: The random seed to be used in producing random ints for selecting
///      which nodes to process next
/// :param int parallel_threshold: The number of nodes in the graph that will
///     trigger the use of parallel threads. If the number of nodes in the graph is less
///     than this value it will run in a single thread. The default value is 50.
///
/// This function is multithreaded and will launch a thread pool with threads equal to
/// the number of CPUs by default. You can tune the number of threads with
/// the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable. For example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4``
/// would limit the thread pool to 4 threads.
///
/// :returns: A list of tuples which are the swaps to be applied to the mapping to rearrange
///      the tokens.
/// :rtype: EdgeList
