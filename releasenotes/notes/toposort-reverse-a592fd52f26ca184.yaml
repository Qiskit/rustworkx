    :func:`.lexicographical_topological_sort` and :class:`.TopologicalSorter` now accept a
    ``reverse`` keyword argument, which can be set to ``True`` to find a "reversed" topological
    ordering.  This is a topological ordering that would be found if all the edges in the graph had
    their directions reversed.
