    Previously, the graphs created by :func:`rustworkx.generators.directed_hexagonal_lattice_graph`
    and :func:`rustworkx.generators.hexagonal_lattice_graph` contained holes in the node indices.
    This has been fixed by generating graphs with consecutive node indexes.
    Fixed `#373 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/373>`__
