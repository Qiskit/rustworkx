    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.bridges` that finds the bridges of
    an undirected :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`.
    Bridges are edges that, if removed, would increase the number of connected 
    components of a graph. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.PyGraph()
      graph.extend_from_edge_list([
          (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3)
      ])
      bridges = rustworkx.bridges(graph)
      bridges_set = [set(edge) for edge in bridges]
      
      colors = []
      for edge in graph.edge_list():
        color = "red" if set(edge) in bridges_set else "black"
        colors.append(color)
      mpl_draw(graph, edge_color=colors)

    Added a new function ``bridges`` to the ``rustworkx_core:connectivity:biconnected``
    module that finds the bridges of an undirected graph.
    Bridges are edges that, if removed, would increase the number of connected 
    components of a graph. For example:
