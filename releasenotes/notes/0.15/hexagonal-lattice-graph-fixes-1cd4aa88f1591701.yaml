    Fixed two bugs in the node position calculation done by the generator functions
    :func:`.hexagonal_lattice_graph` and :func:`.directed_hexagonal_lattice_graph` when 
    ``with_positions = True``:

      * Corrected a scale factor that made all the hexagons in the lattice irregular
      * Corrected an indexing bug that positioned the nodes in the last column of
        the lattice incorrectly when ``periodic = False`` and ``cols`` is odd
