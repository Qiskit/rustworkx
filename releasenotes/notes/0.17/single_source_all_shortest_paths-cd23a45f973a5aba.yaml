      Added `single_source_all_shortest_paths` function to compute all shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
      This function supports both PyGraph and PyDiGraph, with an option to treat directed graphs as undirected.
      See the documentation for usage and performance warnings.
