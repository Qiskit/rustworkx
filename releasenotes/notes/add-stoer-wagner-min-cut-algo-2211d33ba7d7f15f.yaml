    Added a new algorithm function,
    :func:`retworkx.stoer_wagner_min_cut` that uses the
    Stoer Wagner algorithm for computing a weighted minimum cut
    in an undirected graph.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx

      graph = retworkx.generators.grid_graph(2, 2)
      cut_val, partition = retworkx.stoer_wagner_min_cut(graph)
