    Added a new method, :meth:`~.PyDiGraph.make_symmetric`, to the
    :class:`~.PyDiGraph` class. This method is used to make all the edges
    in the graph symmetric (there is a reverse edge in the graph for each edge).
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import graphviz_draw

        graph = rx.generators.directed_path_graph(5, bidirectional=False)
        graph.make_symmetric()
        graphviz_draw(graph)
