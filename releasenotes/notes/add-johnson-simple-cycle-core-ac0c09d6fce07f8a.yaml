features:
  - |
    Added a new function, ``johnson_simple_cycles``, to the ``rustworkx-core``
    crate. This function implements `Johnson's algorithm <https://doi.org/10.1137/0204007>`__ for finding all
    elementary cycles in a directed graph.
  - |
    Added a new trait ``EdgeFindable`` to find an ``EdgeIndex`` from a graph
    given a pair of node indices.
  - |
    Added a new trait ``EdgeRemovable`` to remove an edge from a graph by
    its ``EdgeIndex``.
