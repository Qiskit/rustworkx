    :meth:`.TopologicalSorter.done` now accepts single integers, in addition to lists of integers.
    This can be a sizeable performance improvement for algorithms that iterate through nodes, and
    only conditionally mark them as `done`; there is no longer a need to allocate a temporary Python
    array.
