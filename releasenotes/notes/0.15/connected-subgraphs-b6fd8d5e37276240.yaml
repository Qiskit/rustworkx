    Added a function :func:`~rustworkx.connected_subgraphs` to determine all connected subgraphs of size :math:`k` in
    polynomial delay for undirected graphs. This improves upon the brute-force method by two orders of magnitude for
    sparse graphs such as heavy-hex, enabling addressing larger graphs and for a larger :math:`k`. The introduced method is
    based on "Enumerating Connected Induced Subgraphs: Improved Delay and Experimental Comparison" by Christian
    Komusiewicz and Frank Sommer. In particular, the procedure ``Simple`` is implemented. Possible runtime improvement can
    be gained by parallelization over each recursion or by following the discussion in Lemma 4 of above work and thus
    implementing intermediate sets :math:`X` and :math:`P` more efficiently.
