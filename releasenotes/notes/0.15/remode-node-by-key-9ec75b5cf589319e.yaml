    Added the :meth:`.PyDiGraph.remove_node_retain_edges_by_id` and
    :meth:`~.PyDiGraph.remove_node_retain_edges_by_key` methods, which provide a node-removal that
    is linear in the degree of the node, as opposed to quadratic like
    :meth:`~.PyDiGraph.remove_node_retain_edges`.  These methods require, respectively, that the
    edge weights are referentially identical if they should be retained (``a is b``, in Python), or
    that you can supply a ``key`` function that produces a Python-hashable result that is used to
    do the equality matching between input and output edges.
