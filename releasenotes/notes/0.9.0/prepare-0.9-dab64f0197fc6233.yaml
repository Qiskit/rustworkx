    This release is a new feature release that includes a plethora of new
    features and bug fixes. The highlights of this release are the introduction
    of the :mod:`retwork.visualization` module, which includes a
    `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ based drawer
    (:func:`~rustworkx.visualization.mpl_draw`) and a
    `graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`__ based drawer
    (:func:`~rustworkx.visualization.graphviz_draw`), and layout functions such
    as :func:`~rustworkx.spring_layout` for generating a layout in
    visualization. Additionally, the generator functions in
    :mod:`rustworkx.generators` have been expanded to include new graph
    generators, and many new algorithm functions have been added.
