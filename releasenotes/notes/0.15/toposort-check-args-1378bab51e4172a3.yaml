    :class:`.TopologicalSorter` now has a ``check_args`` keyword argument, which can be set to
    ``False`` to disable the runtime detection of invalid arguments to
    :meth:`~.TopologicalSorter.done`.  This provides a memory and runtime improvement to the online
    sorter, at the cost that the results will be undefined and likely meaningless if invalid values
    are given.
