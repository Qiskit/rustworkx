    Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.15 where the edge colors specified as
    a list in calls to :func:`~rustworkx.visualization.mpl_draw` were not
    having their order respected. Instead, the order of the colors was
    being shuffled. This has been restored and now the behavior should
    match that of 0.14.
