    Rustworkx functions that return custom iterable objects, such as
    :meth:`.PyDiGraph.node_indices`, now each have an associated custom
    iterator and reversed-iterator object for these.  This provides a speedup
    of approximately 40% for iterating through the custom iterables.

    These types are not directly nameable or constructable from Python space, and other than the
    performance improvement, the behavior should largely not be noticable from Python space.
