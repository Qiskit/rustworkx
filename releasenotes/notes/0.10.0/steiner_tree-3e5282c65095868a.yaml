    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.metric_closure`, which is used
    to generate the metric closure of a given graph. This function is used in
    the computation for calculating the Steiner Tree using the algorithm
    from
    Kou, Markowsky & Berman (1981). "A fast algorithm for Steiner trees".
