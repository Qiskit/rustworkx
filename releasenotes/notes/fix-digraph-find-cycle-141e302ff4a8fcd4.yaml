fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the behavior of :func:`~rustworkx.digraph_find_cycle` when
    no source node was provided. Previously, the function would start looking
    for a cycle at an arbitrary node which was not guaranteed to return a cycle.
    Now, the function will smartly choose a source node to start the search from
    such that if a cycle exists, it will be found.

    The `rustworkx-core` function `rustworkx_core::connectivity::find_cycle` now
    requires the `petgraph::visit::Visitable` trait.
