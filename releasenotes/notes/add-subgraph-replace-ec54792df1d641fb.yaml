    A new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.substitute_node_with_subgraph`,
    to the :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` class. This method is used to replace a
    node in a :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` object with another
    :class:`~retwork.PyDiGraph` object. For example, first creating a new
    graph:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      original_graph = retworkx.generators.directed_path_graph(5)
      mpl_draw(original_graph)

    then create another graph to use in place of a node:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      other_graph = retworkx.generators.directed_star_graph(25)
      mpl_draw(other_graph)

    finally replace a node in the original graph with the second graph:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      def edge_map_fn(_source, _target, _weight):
          return 0

      node_mapping = original_graph.substitute_node_with_subgraph(2, other_graph, edge_map_fn)
      print(node_mapping)
      mpl_draw(original_graph)
