    The :class:`PyDiGraph() <rustworkx.PyDiGraph>` and :class:`PyGraph() <rustworkx.PyGraph>`
    classes now have better support for
    `PEP 560 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0560/>`__. Building off of the previous
    releases which introduced type annotations, the following code snippet is now valid:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx as rx

      graph: rx.PyGraph[int, int] = rx.PyGraph()


    Previously, users had to rely on post-poned evaluation of type annotations from
    `PEP 563 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/>`__ for annotations to work.

    Refer to `issue 1345 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/1345>`__ for
    more information.
