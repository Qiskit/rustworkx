    Added a new method, :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.has_parallel_edges`, to the
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`
    (:meth:`~rustworkx.PyGraph.has_parallel_edges`) classes. This method returns
    ``True`` if there are parallel edges in the graph and ``False`` otherwise.
