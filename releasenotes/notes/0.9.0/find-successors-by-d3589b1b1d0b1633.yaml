    Added two new methods, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.find_successors_by_edge`
    and :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.find_predecessors_by_edge`, to
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph`. These methods efficiently retrieve the
    neighbors in the graph which are connected to a node with edges matching a
    filter function.
