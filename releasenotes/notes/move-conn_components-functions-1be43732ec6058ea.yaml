    The rustworkx-core ``connectivity`` module has 3 new functions,
    ``connected_components``, ``number_connected_components``, and
    ``bfs_undirected``. These functions are based on the existing
    :func:`~.connected_components`, :func:`~.number_connected_components`,
    and :func:`~.bfs_undirected` in rustworkx.
