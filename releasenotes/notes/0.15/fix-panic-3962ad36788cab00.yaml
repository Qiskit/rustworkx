    Fixed an issue with the Dijkstra path functions:

      * :func:`rustworkx.dijkstra_shortest_paths`
      * :func:`rustworkx.dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths`
      * :func:`rustworkx.bellman_ford_shortest_path_lengths`
      * :func:`rustworkx.bellman_ford_shortest_paths`
      * :func:`rustworkx.astar_shortest_path`

    where a ``PanicException`` was raised without much detail when an
    invalid node index was passed in to the ``source`` argument. This has been
    corrected so an ``IndexError`` is raised instead.
    Fixed `#1117 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/1117>`__
