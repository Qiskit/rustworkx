    Added a new algorithm function,
    :func:`retworkx.stoer_wagner_min_cut` that uses the
    Stoer Wagner algorithm for computing a weighted minimum cut
    in an undirected :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph`.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = retworkx.generators.grid_graph(2, 2)
      cut_val, partition = retworkx.stoer_wagner_min_cut(graph)

      colors = [
          'orange' if node in partition else 'blue' for node in graph.node_indexes()
      ]
      mpl_draw(graph, node_color=colors)
