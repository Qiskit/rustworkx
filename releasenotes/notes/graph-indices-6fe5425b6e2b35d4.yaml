    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indices`, to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDigraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes.
    This method is identical to the previously existing
    :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indexes` method but changes the name
    to be consistent with the use of "indices" throughout the rest of
    retworkx. The :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.node_indexes` will likely
    be deprecated in a future release prior to it's removal in an eventual
    1.0 release.
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.incident_edges`, to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` class. This method returns a list of edge
    indices for edges incident to a provided node.
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.get_edge_data_by_index`,
    to the :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes.
    This method returns the data payload for an edge in the graph from its
    index.
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.get_edge_endpoints_by_index`,
    to the :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes.
    This method returns the edge's endpoint tuple for an edge in the graph from
    its index.
