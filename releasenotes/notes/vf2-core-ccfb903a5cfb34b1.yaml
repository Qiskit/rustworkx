    Graph isomorphism using VF2(++) is now supported in ``rustworkx-core``
    for ``petgraph`` graph types ``StableGraph`` and ``Graph`` (it may also
    work for ``GraphMap``, but this is not verified).
    To use it, import ``rustworkx_core::isomorphism::vf2`` which provides
    function :func:`.is_isomorphic` for isomorphism testing in addition to the
    ``Vf2Algorithm`` struct, which can be used to iterate over valid
    isomorphic matches of two graphs. It also provides traits ``EdgeMatcher``
    and ``NodeMatcher``, which allow a user-provided implementation of
    node and edge equality.
