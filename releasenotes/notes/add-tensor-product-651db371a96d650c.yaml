    Add two new functions which calculates the tensor product of two graphs :func:`~retworkx.graph_tensor_product`
    for undirected graphs and :func:`~retworkx.digraph_tensor_product` for directed graphs. For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw
      graph_1 = retworkx.generators.path_graph(2)
      graph_2 = retworkx.generators.path_graph(3)
      graph_product, _ = retworkx.graph_tensor_product(graph_1, graph_2)
      
      mpl_draw(graph_product)
