    In previous releases the Python garbage collector did not know how to
    interact with :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` or :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`
    objects and as a result they may never have been freed until Python exited.
    To fix this issue, the :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` classes now are integrated with Python's garbage
    collector so they'll properly be cleared when there are no more references
    to a graph object.
