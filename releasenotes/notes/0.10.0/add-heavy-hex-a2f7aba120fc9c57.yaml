    Added new generator functions,
    :func:`retworkx.generators.heavy_hex_graph` and
    :func:`retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_hex_graph`, for constructing a
    heavy hex graphs from:
    https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011022
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_hex_graph(3)
      mpl_draw(graph)
