    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.local_complement` which
    performs the local complementation of a node applied to a graph 
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        
        # Example taken from Figure 1 a) in https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03969
        graph = rustworkx.PyGraph(multigraph=False)
        graph.extend_from_edge_list(
            [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]
        )

        complement_graph = rustworkx.local_complement(graph, 0)
