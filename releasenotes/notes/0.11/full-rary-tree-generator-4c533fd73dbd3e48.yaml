    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.generators.full_rary_tree` that adds
    support for generating a full :math:`r`\ -ary tree of :math:`n` nodes. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx.generators
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

        graph = rustworkx.generators.full_rary_tree(3, 5)
        mpl_draw(graph)
