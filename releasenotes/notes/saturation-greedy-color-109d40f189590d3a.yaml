features:
  - Added a new class :class:`~.GreedyStrategy` used to specify the strategy used by 
    the greedy node and edge coloring algorithms. 
    The `Degree` strategy colors the nodes with higher degree first.
    The `Saturation` strategy dynamically chooses the vertex that has the largest 
    number of different colors already assigned to its neighbors, and, in case of a tie, 
    the vertex that has the largest number of uncolored neighbors.
    The `IndependentSet` strategy finds independent subsets of the graph, and assigns 
    a different color to each of these subsets.

    Added a new keyword argument, ``greedy_strategy``, to :func:`.graph_greedy_color`
    and to :func:`.graph_greedy_edge_color` to specify the greedy coloring strategy.
    
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

        graph = rx.generators.generalized_petersen_graph(5, 2)

        coloring = rx.graph_greedy_color(graph, greedy_strategy=rx.GreedyStrategy.Saturation)
        colors = [coloring[node] for node in graph.node_indices()]

        layout = rx.shell_layout(graph, nlist=[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],[6, 7, 8, 9, 5]])
        mpl_draw(graph, node_color=colors, pos=layout)
