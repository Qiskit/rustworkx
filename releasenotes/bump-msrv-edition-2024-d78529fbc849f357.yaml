    The minimum supported rust version to build rustworkx and rustworkx-core
    has been raised from 1.79 to 1.85. You will need to upgrade your Rust
    compiler version to at least version 1.85 to continue building from source.
    The new MSRV has allowed rustworkx to upgrade to Rust Edition 2024.

    Python library users who are installing rustworkx on a supported platform
    will not need to make any changes.
