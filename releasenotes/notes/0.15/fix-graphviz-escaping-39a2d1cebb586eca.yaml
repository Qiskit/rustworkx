    Fixed an issue in the :func:`~.graphviz_draw`, :meth:`.PyGraph.to_dot`, and
    :meth:`.PyDiGraph.to_dot` which was incorrectly escaping strings when
    upgrading to 0.15.0. In earlier versions of rustworkx if you manually
    placed quotes in a string for an attr callback to get that to pass through
    to the output dot file, this was incorrectly being converted in rustworkx
    0.15.0 to duplicate the quotes and escape them. For example, if you defined
    a callback like::

        def color_node(_node):
            return {
                "color": '"#422952"'
            }

    to set the color attribute in the output dot file with the string
    ``"#422952"`` (with the quotes), this was incorrectly being converted to
    ``"\"#422952\""``. This no longer occurs, in rustworkx 0.16.0 there will
    likely be additional options exposed in :func:`~.graphviz_draw`,
    :meth:`.PyGraph.to_dot`, and :meth:`.PyDiGraph.to_dot` to expose further
    options around this.
