    This release 0.12.0 is the last release that will provide binaries that
    support the `manylinux2010 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0571/>`__ packaging
    specification. Starting in Rustworkx 0.13.0 all the precompiled binaries
    will be built against manylinux2014. This change is required due to
    changes in the GLIBC versions supported by the Rust compiler. If you need
    to run Rustworkx on a platform only compatible with manylinux2010 for
    future releases you will need to build from source and also use a
    Rust compiler with a version < 1.64.0.
