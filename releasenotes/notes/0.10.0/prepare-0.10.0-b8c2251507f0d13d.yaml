prelude: |
  This release includes many new features and bug fixes. The highlights of this
  release are a slew of new algorithm functions including
  :func:`~rustworkx.steiner_tree` and :func:`~rustworkx.betweenness_centrality`,
  improvements to the isomorphism functions including the addition of
  :func:`~rustworkx.vf2_mapping` to get an isomorphic mapping between two
  graphs, and improvements to working with graph objects such as
  :meth:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph.substitute_node_with_subgraph` for replacing a
  node with a subgraph.
fixes:
  - |
    The iteration order of the output ``dict`` returned by
    :func:`~rustworkx.graph_greedy_color` was previously not deterministic
    and multiple executions with the same input would return identical
    dictionaries that had different insertion orders which would result in
    different iteration order. This has been fixed so that the iteration order
    of the output dictionary is now deterministic.
    Fixed `#347 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/347>`__
