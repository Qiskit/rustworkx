    Added a new function, :func:`~retworkx.closeness_centrality` to compute
    closeness centrality of all nodes in a :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` or
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` object. 

    The closeness centrality of a node :math:`u` is the reciprocal of the
    average shortest path distance to :math:`u` over all :math:`n-1` reachable
    nodes.
  
    .. math::
  
        C(u) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},
  
    where :math:`d(v, u)` is the shortest-path distance between :math:`v` and
    :math:`u`, and :math:`n` is the number of nodes that can reach :math:`u`.
    
    Wasserman and Faust propose an improved formula for graphs with more than
    one connected component. The result is "a ratio of the fraction of actors
    in the group who are reachable, to the average distance" from the reachable
    actors.
    
    .. math::

        C_{WF}(u) = \frac{n-1}{N-1} \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},
    
    where :math:`N` is the number of nodes in the graph. By default, this is
    enabled.
