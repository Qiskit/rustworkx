    Added a new :func:`~retworkx.dfs_search` (and it's per type variants
    :func:`~retworkx.graph_dfs_search` and :func:`~retworkx.digraph_dfs_search`)
    that traverses the graph in a depth-first manner and emits events at specified
    points. The events are handled by a visitor object that subclasses
    :class:`~retworkx.visit.DFSVisitor` through the appropriate callback functions.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visit import DFSVisitor

      class TreeEdgesRecorder(DFSVisitor):

          def __init__(self):
              self.edges = []

          def tree_edge(self, edge):
              self.edges.append(edge)

      graph = retworkx.PyGraph()
      graph.extend_from_edge_list([(1, 3), (0, 1), (2, 1), (0, 2)])
      vis = TreeEdgesRecorder()
      retworkx.dfs_search(graph, [0], vis)
      print('Tree edges:', vis.edges)
