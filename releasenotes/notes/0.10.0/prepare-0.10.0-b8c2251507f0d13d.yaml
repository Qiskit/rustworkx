  This release is a new feature release that includes many new features and
  bug fixes. The highlights of this release are a slew of new algorithm
  functions including :func:`~retworkx.steiner_tree` and
  :func:`~retworkx.betweenness_centrality`, improvements to the isomorphism
  functions including the addition of :func:`~retworkx.vf2_mapping` to get
  an isomorphic mapping between two graphs, and improvements to working with
  graph objects such as :meth:`retworkx.PyDiGraph.substitute_node_with_subgraph`
  for replacing a node with a subgraph.
fixes:
  - |
    The iteration order of the output ``dict`` returned by
    :func:`~retworkx.graph_greedy_color` was previously not deterministic
    and multiple executions with the same input would return identical
    dictionaries that had different insertion orders which would result in
    different iteration order. This has been fixed so that the iteration order
    of the output dictionary is now deterministic.
    Fixed `#347 <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/issues/347>`__
