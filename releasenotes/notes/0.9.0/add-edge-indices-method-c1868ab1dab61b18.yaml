features:
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.edge_indices`, to the
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`
    (:meth:`~rustworkx.PyGraph.edge_indices`) that will return a list of
    edge indices for every edge in the graph object.
  - |
    Added a new custom return type :class:`~rustworkx.EdgeIndices` which is
    returned by :class:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph.edge_indices` and
    :class:`rustworkx.PyGraph.edge_indices`. It is equivalent to a read-only
    list of integers that represent a list of edge indices.
