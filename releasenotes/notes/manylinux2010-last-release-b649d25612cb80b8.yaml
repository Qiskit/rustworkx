    This release no longer provides binaries that support the
    `manylinux2010 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0571/>`__ packaging specification.
    All the precompiled binaries for Linux platforms are built against
    `manylinux2014 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0599/>`__. This change is required
    due to changes in the GLIBC versions supported by the latest versions of the
    Rust compiler in addition to the manylinux2010 platform no longer being
    supported. If you need to run Rustworkx on a platform only compatible with
    manylinux2010 starting with this release you will need to build and install
    from source (which includes the sdist published to PyPI, so
    `pip install rustworkx` will continue to work assuming you have a Rust compiler
    installed) and also use a Rust compiler with a version < 1.64.0.
