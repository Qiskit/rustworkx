    Added a new function, :func:`~.hits()` which is used to
    compute the hubs and authorities for all nodes in a given directed graph.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

        graph = rx.generators.directed_hexagonal_lattice_graph(2, 2)
        hubs, _ = rx.hits(graph)

        # Generate a color list
        colors = []
        for node in graph.node_indices():
            hub_score = hubs[node]
            graph[node] = hub_score
            colors.append(hub_score)
        mpl_draw(
            graph,
            with_labels=True,
            node_color=colors,
            node_size=650,
            labels=lambda x: "{0:.2f}".format(x)
        )
