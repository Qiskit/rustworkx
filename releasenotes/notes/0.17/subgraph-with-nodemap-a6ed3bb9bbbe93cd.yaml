    Added new :meth:`~.PyGraph.subgraph_with_nodemap` and :meth:`~.PyDiGraph.subgraph_with_nodemap`
    methods to the :class:`~.PyGraph` and :class:`~.PyDiGraph` classes. These methods extend the
    existing :meth:`~.PyGraph.subgraph` method by returning a :class:`~.NodeMap` object that maps
    the nodes of the subgraph to the nodes of the original graph.
