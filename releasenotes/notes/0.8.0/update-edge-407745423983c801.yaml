    Two new methods, :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.update_edge` and
    :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.update_edge_by_index` were added to the
    :class:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`rustworkx.PyGraph` (
    :meth:`~rustworkx.PyGraph.update_edge` and
    :meth:`~rustworkx.PyGraph.update_edge_by_index`) classes. These methods
    are used to update the data payload/weight of an edge in the graph either
    by the nodes of an edge or by edge index.
