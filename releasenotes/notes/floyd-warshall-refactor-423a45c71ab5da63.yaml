upgrade:
  - |
    :func:`~retworkx.floyd_warshall` has been completely reworked and now returns
    a :class:`retworkx.AllPairsPathLengthMapping` instead of a Python dictionary.
    The function now supports custom edge weights via a `weight_fn` function and
    accepts the :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` type as well.
  - |
    Added two new function, :func:`~retworkx.graph_floyd_warshall` and :func:`~retworkx.digraph_floyd_warshall`,
    which are typed versions of the new improved :func:`~retworkx.floyd_warshall`.
