    Added a new function ``two_color`` to the rustworkx-core ``rustworkx_core::coloring``
    module. This function is used to compute a two coloring of a graph and can
    also be used to determine if a graph is bipartite as it returns ``None``
    when a two coloring is not possible.
  - |
    Added a new function, :func:`~.two_color`, which is used to compute a
    two coloring for a graph. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx as rx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rx.generators.heavy_square_graph(5)
      colors = rx.two_color(graph)
      mpl_draw(graph, node_color=[colors[i] for i in range(len(graph))])
  - |
    Added a new function, :func:`~.is_bipartite` to determine whether a given
    graph object is bipartite or not.
