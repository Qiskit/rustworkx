    Added a new function :func:`~rustworkx.digraph_maximum_bisimulation` to
    compute the maximum bisimulation or relational coarsest partition of a
    graph. This function is based on the algorithm described in the publication
    "Three partition refinement algorithms" by Paige and Tarjan. This function
    recieves a graph and returns a
    :class:`~rustworkx.RelationalCoarsestPartition`.
  - |
    Added a new class :class:`~rustworkx.RelationalCoarsestPartition` to output
    the maximum bisimulation or relational coarsest partition of a graph. This
    class contains instances of :class:`~rustworkx.IndexPartitionBlock` and can be
    iterated over.

    Added a new class :class:`~rustworkx.IndexPartitionBlock` to output
    a block of a node partition. This class is an iterator over node indices.
