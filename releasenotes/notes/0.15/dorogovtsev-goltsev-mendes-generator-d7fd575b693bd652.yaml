    Added :func:`rustworkx.generators.dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph` that generates
    deterministic scale-free graphs using the Dorogovtsev-Goltsev-Mendes iterative procedure.

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx as rx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rx.generators.dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph(2)
      mpl_draw(graph)

    Added a new function, ``rustworkx_core::generators::dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph``, to
    rustworkx-core that is used to generate deterministic scale-free graphs using the
    Dorogovtsev-Goltsev-Mendes iterative procedure.
