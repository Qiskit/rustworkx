    Fixed the plots of multigraphs using :func:`.mpl_draw`. Previously, parallel edges of 
    multigraphs were plotted on top of each other, with overlapping arrows and labels. 
    The radius of parallel edges of the multigraph was fixed to be `0.25` for 
    `connectionstyle` supporting this argument in :func:`.draw_edges`. The edge lables 
    were offset to `0.25` in :func:`.draw_edge_labels` to align with their respective 
    edges. This fix can be tested using the following code: 

        .. jupyter-execute::

            import rustworkx
            from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

            graph = rustworkx.PyDiGraph()
            graph.add_node('A')
            graph.add_node('B')
            graph.add_node('C')

            graph.add_edge(1, 0, 2)
            graph.add_edge(0, 1, 3)
            graph.add_edge(1, 2, 4)

            mpl_draw(graph, with_labels=True, labels=str, edge_labels=str, alpha=0.5)
