    Added support for musl Linux platforms on x86_64 and aarch64 at :ref:`tier-3`.
upgrade:
  - |
    Support for the Linux ppc64le pllatform has changed from tier 3 to tier 4
    (as documented in :ref:`platform-suppport`). This is a result of no longer
    being able to run tests during the pre-compiled wheel publishing jobs due
    to constraints in the available CI infrastructure. There hopefully
    shouldn't be any meaningful impact resulting from this change, but as there
    are no longer tests being run to validate the binaries prior to publishing
    them there are no longer guarantees that the wheels for ppc64le are fully
    functional (although the likelihood they are is still high as it works on
    other platforms). If any issues are encountered with ppc64le Linux please
    open an issue.
