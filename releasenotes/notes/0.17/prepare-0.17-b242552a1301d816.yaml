  This is a new Rustworkx release with bug fixes and new features to
  the library. The highlights of this release are:

    * Enhanced documentation and tests
    * Support for writing GraphML files
    * A new method for weighted closeness closeness

  This release uses the `Python Stable ABI <https://docs.python.org/3.9/c-api/stable.html>`__,
  and will be compatible with all versions from Python 3.9 onwards. The published
  binaries have been tested with Python 3.9 to 3.13, although they will likely
  work with future versions like 3.14.

  A special shoutout goes to Miroslav Šedivý, Etienne Wodey, Krishn Parasar, and Barak Katzir
  for their pull requests and GitHub issues! Although not documented in individual
  entries, we appreciate your work helping us improve our documentation, type annotations, and tests.
