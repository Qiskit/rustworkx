    Added a new exception class :class:`~.GraphNotBipartite` which is raised when a 
    graph is not bipartite. The sole user of this exception is the :func:`~.graph_bipartite_edge_color` 
    which will raise it when the user provided graph is not bipartite.

    Added a new function, :func:`~.graph_bipartite_edge_color` to color edges
    of a :class:`~.PyGraph` object. The function first checks whether a graph is
    bipartite, raising exception of type :class:`~.GraphNotBipartite` if this is not the case.
    Otherwise, the function calls the algorithm for edge-coloring bipartite graphs,
    and returns a dictionary with key being the edge index and value being the assigned
    color.
    
    The implemented algorithm is based on the paper "A simple algorithm for edge-coloring 
    bipartite multigraphs" by Noga Alon, 2003.
       
    The coloring produces at most d colors where d is the maximum degree of a node in the graph.
    The algorithm runs in time ``O (m log m)``, where ``m`` is the number of edges in the graph.
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        import rustworkx as rx  
        from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw
    
        graph = rx.generators.cycle_graph(8)
        edge_colors = rx.graph_bipartite_edge_color(graph)
        assert edge_colors == {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 0, 7: 1}
        mpl_draw(graph, edge_color=[edge_colors[i] for i in range(graph.num_edges())])

    Added two new random graph generator functions,
    :func:`.directed_random_bipartite_graph` and :func:`.undirected_random_bipartite_graph`,
    to generate a random bipartite graph. For example:

        .. jupyter-execute::

            import rustworkx as rx
            from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

            random_graph = rx.undirected_random_bipartite_graph(10, 5, 0.5, seed=20)
            mpl_draw(random_graph)
