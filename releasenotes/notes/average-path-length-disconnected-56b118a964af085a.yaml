    Updates the way :func:`~unweighted_average_shortest_path_length` handles
    disconnected graphs. Previously, disconnected pairs of nodes was assumed
    to have zero distance and this has been changed to an infinite value.
    In addition, an extra kwarg ``disconnected`` was added where, if set to
    ``True``, the average is taken only over connected node pairs. By default,
    it's set to ``False``.
