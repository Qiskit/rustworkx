    Updates the way :func:`~unweighted_average_shortest_path_length` handles
    disconnected graphs. Previously, disconnected pairs of nodes was assumed
    to have zero distance and this has been changed to an infinite value.
    In addition, an extra kwarg ``disconnected`` was added where, if set to
    ``True``, the average is taken only over connected node pairs. By default,
    it's set to ``False``. If the old behavior is desired, it can be reproduced
    using the rest of retworkx API like:

    .. code-block:: python

      import retworkx

      graph = retworkx.undirected_gnm_random_graph(20, 10, seed=42)
      n = len(graph)
      d_mat = retworkx.distance_matrix(graph, null_value=0.0)
      avg_shortest_path = d_mat.sum() / (n * (n - 1.0))
