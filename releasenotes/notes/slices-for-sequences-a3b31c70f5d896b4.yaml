    The custom sequence return classes:

     * :class:`~.BFSSSuccessors`
     * :class:`~.NodeIndices`
     * :class:`~.EdgeList`
     * :class:`~WeightedEdgeList`
     * :class:`~EdgeIndices`
     * :class:`~Chains`

    now correctly handle slice inputs to ``__getitem__``. Previously if you
    tried to access a slice from one of these objects it would raise a
    ``TypeError``. For example, if you had a :class:`~.NodeIndices` object named
    ``nodes`` containing ``[0, 1, 3, 4, 5]`` if you did something like::

        nodes[0:3]

    it would return a new :class:`~.NodeIndices` object containing ``[0, 1, 3]``
