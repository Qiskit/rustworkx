    The :func:`~rustworkx.all_simple_paths` function now supports multiple
    target nodes passed as an iterable. You can now pass either a single target
    node (int) or multiple target nodes (iterable of ints) to find all simple
    paths from a source node to any of the specified targets. For example::

        import rustworkx as rx

        graph = rx.generators.path_graph(4)
        # Multiple targets - new functionality
        paths = rx.all_simple_paths(graph, 0, [2, 3])
        # paths: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3]]

    This enhancement maintains backward compatibility while providing more
    flexibility for pathfinding operations in both :class:`~.PyGraph` and
    :class:`~.PyDiGraph` objects.
