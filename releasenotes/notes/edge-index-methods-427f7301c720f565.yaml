features:
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.incident_edges`, to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` class. This
    method returns a list of edge indices for edges incident to a provided node.
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.get_edge_data_by_index`,
    to the :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` classes.
    This method returns the data payload for an edge in the graph from its
    index.
  - |
    Added a new method, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.get_edge_endpoints_by_index`,
    to the :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` classes.
    This method returns the edge's endpoint tuple for an edge in the graph from
    its index.
  - |
    Added two new methods, :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.out_edges` and
    :meth:`~retworkx.PyGraph.in_edges`. These methods are the dual of the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` methods, :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.out_edges`
    and :meth:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph.in_edges` and return a
    :class:`~retworkx.WeightedEdgeList` of the incident edges for a node.
