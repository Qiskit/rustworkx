    Three new random graph generators, ``gnp_random_graph``, ``gnm_random_graph``
    and ``random_geometric_graph``, have been added to the ``rustworkx-core``
    crate in the ``generators`` module. The ``gnp_random_graph`` takes inputs of
    the number of nodes and a probability for adding edges. The ``gnp_random_graph``
    takes inputs of the number of nodes and number of edges. The
    ``random_geometric_graph`` creates a random graph within an n-dimensional
    cube.

    Passing a negative value to the ``probability`` argument to the
    :func:`~rustworkx.gnp_directed_random_graph` or the
    :func:`~rustworkx.gnp_undirected_random_graph` function will now cause
    an ``OverflowError`` to be raised. Previously, a ``ValueError`` would be
    raised in this situation. This was changed to be consistent with other similar
    error conditions in other functions in the library.
