    Added two new methods, :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.get_edge_index`
    and :meth:`~rustworkx.PyGraph.get_edge_index`, which add support for finding
    the index of an edge using its endpoints. The edge returned should be the same as
    the one modified by `~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.update_edge` and
    `~rustworkx.PyGraph.update_edge` respectively.
