    Exposed the `can_contract_without_cycle` method on `PyDiGraph` object. This method enables users to check, prior to contraction, whether merging a set of nodes into a single node would introduce a cycle in the graph. This is especially useful for applications that require maintaining acyclic properties, such as working with DAGs.
