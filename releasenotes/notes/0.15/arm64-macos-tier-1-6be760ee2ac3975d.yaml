    Support for the arm64 macOS platform has been promoted from :ref:`tier-4`
    to :ref:`tier-1`. Previously the platform was at :ref:`tier-4` because
    there was no available CI environment for testing rustworkx on the platform.
    Now that Github has made an arm64 macOS environment available to open source
    projects [#]_ we're testing the platform along with the other :ref:`tier-1`
    supported platforms.
