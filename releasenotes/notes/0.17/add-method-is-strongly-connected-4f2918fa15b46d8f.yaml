    Added two new functions: :func:`~rustworkx.is_strongly_connected` and
    :func:`~rustworkx.number_strongly_connected_components`
    to the ``rustworkx.PyDiGraph`` class.
    These functions check whether the directed graph is strongly connected,
    and the number of such components, respectively.
    They are the “strongly-connected” pendants for the already existing 
    “weakly-connected” methods.
