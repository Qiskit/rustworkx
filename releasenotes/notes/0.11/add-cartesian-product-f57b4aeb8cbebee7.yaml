    Added a new function, :func:`~retworkx.cartesian_product` (and its per
    type variants :func:`~retworkx.digraph_cartesian_product` and
    :func:`~retworkx.graph_cartesian_product`), which calculates the Cartesian
    product of two graphs. For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph_1 = retworkx.generators.path_graph(2)
      graph_2 = retworkx.generators.path_graph(3)

      graph_product, _ = retworkx.cartesian_product(graph_1, graph_2)
      
      mpl_draw(graph_product)
