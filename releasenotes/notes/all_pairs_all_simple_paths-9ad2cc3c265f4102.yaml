    Added a new function :func:`~.all_pairs_all_simple_paths` which
    is used to return all simple paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. It
    can also be used with a optional ``min_depth`` and ``cutoff`` parameters to
    filter the results based on path lengths. For example::

        from retworkx.generators import grid_graph
        from retworkx import find_all_pairs_all_simple_paths_of_size

        g = grid_graph(2, 3)
        paths = find_all_pairs_all_simple_paths_of_size(g, min_depth=3, cutoff=3)

    will return a dictionary of dictionaries where the 2 dictionary keys are the
    node indices and the inner value is the list of all simple paths of length
    3 between those 2 nodes.
