    Added a new function :func:`~rustworkx.articulation_points` that
    finds the articulation points of an undirected :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`.
    An articulation point or cut vertex is any node whose removal increases
    the number of connected components of a graph. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.PyGraph()
      graph.extend_from_edge_list([
          (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3)
      ])
      points = rustworkx.articulation_points(graph)

      colors = ['black'] * len(graph)
      for node in points:
          colors[node] = 'blue'

      mpl_draw(graph, node_color=colors)

    Added a new function :func:`~rustworkx.biconnected_components` that
    returns the biconnected components of an undirected :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`.
    A biconnected component is a maximal subgraph that remains connected
    after removal of a node. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.PyGraph()
      graph.extend_from_edge_list([
          (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
      ])
      components = rustworkx.biconnected_components(graph)

      COLORS = ["blue", "red", "orange"]
      edge_colors = []
      for (u, v) in graph.edge_list():
        if (u, v) in components:
            comp = components[(u, v)]
        else:
            comp = components[(v, u)]
        edge_colors += [COLORS[comp]] 

      mpl_draw(graph, node_color='black', node_size=150,
              edge_color=edge_colors)
