/// Generates Zachary's Karate Club graph.

/// Zachary's Karate Club graph is a well-known social network that represents

/// Arguments:
///
/// * `default_node_weight` - A callable that will receive a boolean, indicating
///     if a node is part of Mr Hi's faction (True) or the Officer's faction (false).
///     It shoudl return the node weight according to the desired type.
/// * `default_edge_weight` - A callable that will receive the integer representing
///     the strenght of the relation between two nodes. It should return the edge
///      weight according to the desired type.
