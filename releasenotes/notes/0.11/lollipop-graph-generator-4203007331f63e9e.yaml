    Added a new function, :func:`~retworkx.generators.lollipop_graph` that adds
    support for generating lollipop graphs. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import retworkx.generators
        from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

        graph = retworkx.generators.lollipop_graph(4, 3)
        mpl_draw(graph)
