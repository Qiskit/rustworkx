    Support for the Linux s390x platform has changed from tier 3 to tier 4 (as
    documented in :ref:`platform-suppport`). This is a result of no longer being
    able to run tests during the pre-compiled wheel publishing jobs due to
    constraints in the available CI infrastructure. There hopefully shouldn't 
    be any meaningful impact resulting from this change, but as there are no longer tests being
    run to validate the binaries prior to publishing them there are no longer
    guarantees that the wheels for s390x are fully functional (although the
    likelihood they are is still high as it works on other platforms). If any
    issues are encountered with s390x Linux please open an issue.
