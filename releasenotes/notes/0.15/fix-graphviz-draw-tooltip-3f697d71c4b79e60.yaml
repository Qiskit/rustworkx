    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.graphviz_draw` where it would not correctly
    escape special characters in all scenarios. This has been corrected so
    you can now use special characters with the function, for example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        import rustworkx as rx
        from rustworkx.visualization import graphviz_draw

        graphviz_draw(
            rx.generators.path_graph(2),
            node_attr_fn=lambda x: {"label": "the\nlabel", "tooltip": "the\ntooltip"},
        )

    Fixed: `#750 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/750>`__
