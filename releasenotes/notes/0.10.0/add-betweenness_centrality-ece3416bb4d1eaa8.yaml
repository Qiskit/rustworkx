    Added a new function, :func:`~retworkx.betweenness_centrality` to compute
    betweenness centrality of all nodes in a :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` or
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` object. The betweenness centrality of a
    node :math:`v` is the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths
    that pass through :math`v`

    .. math::

       c_B(v) =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where :math:`V` is the set of nodes, :math:`\sigma(s, t)` is the number of
    shortest :math:`(s, t)` paths, and :math:`\sigma(s, t|v)` is the number of
    those paths  passing through some  node :math:`v` other than :math:`s, t`.
    If :math:`s = t`, :math:`\sigma(s, t) = 1`, and if :math:`v \in {s, t}`,
    :math:`\sigma(s, t|v) = 0`

    The algorithm used in this function is based on:

    Ulrik Brandes, A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality.
    Journal of Mathematical Sociology 25(2):163-177, 2001.

    For example, computing the betweenness centrality for all nodes in a 5x5
    grid graph and using that to color the nodes in a graph visualization:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx
      from retworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = retworkx.generators.grid_graph(5, 5)
      btw = retworkx.betweenness_centrality(graph)
      # Color nodes in graph visualization with betweenness centrality
      colors = []
      for i in range(len(graph)):
          colors.append(btw[i])
      mpl_draw(graph, node_color=colors)
