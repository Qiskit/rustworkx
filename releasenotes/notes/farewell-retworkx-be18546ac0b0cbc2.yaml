deprecations:
  - |
    We are saying goodbye to the legacy ``retworkx`` package that operates as a
    backwards compatibility alias for ``rustworkx``. It was originally marked as
    deprecated in the 0.12.0 release and this will be its last release it is supported. The ``rustworkx`` name has now existed
    longer than the ``retworkx`` name and the ``retworkx`` package is no longer needed.

    This release will unpin the ``retworkx`` package from the ``rustworkx`` package.
    Historically, we have release ``retworkx`` and `rustworkx` at the same time, with
    ``retworkx`` being an alias to the same ``rustworkx`` package. This will no longer
    be the case.

    We encourage users to migrate to the new name. Thanks to all users that have
    used ``retworkx`` since the early days of the project!
