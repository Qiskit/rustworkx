features:
  - |
    Added a new function ``rustworkx_core::dag_algo::layers`` to rustworkx-core
    to get the layers of a directed acyclic graph.  This is equivalent to the
    :func:`.layers` function that existed in the Python API but now exposes it
    for Rust users too.
fix:
  - |
    When calling :func:`~.layers` with a graph containing a cycle, the
    function will throw a ``DAGHasCycle`` error instance now. Previously, the
    function would get stuck in an infinite loop if a graph with a cycle was
    passed to the function.
