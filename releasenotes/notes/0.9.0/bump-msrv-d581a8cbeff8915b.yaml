    The minimum supported Rust version has increased to 1.41.1, you will need
    rustc >=1.41.1 now to build retworkx. The previous minimum supported Rust
    version 1.39.0 will no longer be able to compile retworkx. This is due to a
    changes in in the new versions of the
    `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`__ and
    `rust-numpy <https://github.com/PyO3/rust-numpy>`__ libraries.
