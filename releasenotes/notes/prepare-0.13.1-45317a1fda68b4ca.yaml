    rustworkx 0.13.1 is a bugfix release, addressing some issues identified
    since the 0.13.0 release.
issues:
  - |
    The type hint stub files included in this release (and 0.13.0) are not
    compatible with Python 3.7's type hinting syntax. If you are now using
    `mypy` to partially validate the typing in your usage of rustworkx, you
    should not run this with Python 3.7 as it will not function correctly.
    The actual rustworkx code will continue to function as expected with
    Python 3.7 for the 0.13.x release series, it was just the typing syntax
    used in the stubs files which are incompatible with Python 3.7.
