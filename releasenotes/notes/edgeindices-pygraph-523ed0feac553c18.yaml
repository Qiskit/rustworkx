    The return type for the :class:`~.PyGraph` method
    :meth:`~.PyGraph.add_edges_from` and
    :meth:`~.PyGraph.add_edges_from_no_data` has changed from a ``list`` of
    integer edge indices to an :class:`~.EdgeIndices` object. The
    :class:`~.EdgeIndices` class is a read-only sequence type of integer
    edge indices. For the most part this should be fully compatible
    except if you were mutating the output list or were explicitly type
    checking the return. In these cases you can simply cast the
    :class:`~.EdgeIndices` object with ``list()``.
