    Added method substitute_node_with_subgraph to the PyGraph class.

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import * # Needs matplotlib/

      graph = rustworkx.generators.complete_graph(5)
      sub_graph = rustworkx.generators.path_graph(3)

      # Replace node 4 in this graph with sub_graph
      # Make sure to connect the graphs at node 2 of the sub_graph
      # This is done by passing a function that returns 2

      graph.substitute_node_with_subgraph(4, sub_graph, lambda _, __, ___: 2)

      # Draw the updated graph
      mpl_draw(graph, with_labels=True)
