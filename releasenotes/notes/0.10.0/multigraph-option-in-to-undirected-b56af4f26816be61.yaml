    Two new kwargs, ``multigraph`` and ``weight_combo_fn``, were added to
    :meth:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph.to_undirected` method. These two options can be
    used to condense parallel edges into a single edge in the output graph. By
    setting ``multigraph`` to ``True`` any parallel edges will be condensed
    into a single edge in the output :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`. The
    ``weight_combo_fn`` kwarg is used to control how the parallel edges are
    condensed. If it's not specified the weight/data payload of the edge with
    the largest edge index will be used. If ``weight_combo_fn`` is specified
    it will be passed the weight objects for any parallel edges in the graph
    and the returned object will be used as the weight for the condensed edge.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import rustworkx
      from rustworkx.visualization import mpl_draw

      graph = rustworkx.PyDiGraph()
      graph.extend_from_weighted_edge_list([
        (0, 1, 25),
        (1, 0, 10),
        (1, 2, 10),
        (2, 1, 100),
        (2, 3, 50),
        (3, 2, 40),
      ])
      undirected_graph = graph.to_undirected(
          multigraph=False, weight_combo_fn=max
      )
      mpl_draw(undirected_graph, with_labels=True, edge_labels=str)
