fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the :func:`~retworkx.dfs_edges` function to have the ``source``
    argument default to ``None`` as was documented. Previously, the ``source``
    argument was incorrectly required and had no default value.
    Fixed `#515 <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/issues/515>`__.
  - |
    Fixed an oversight in the :func:`~retworkx.union` function where
    user-defined values for the ``merge_nodes`` and ``merge_edges`` arguments
    were being ingored.
