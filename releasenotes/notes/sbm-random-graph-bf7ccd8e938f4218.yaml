    Adds new random graph generator in rustworkx for the stochastic block model.
    There is a generator for directed :func:`.directed_sbm_random_graph` and
    undirected graphs :func:`.undirected_sbm_random_graph`.
  - |
    Adds new function ``sbm_random_graph`` to the rustworkx-core module
    ``rustworkx_core::generators`` that samples a graph from the stochastic
    block model.
