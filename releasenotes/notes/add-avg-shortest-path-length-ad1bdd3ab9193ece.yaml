    Added a new algorithm function,
    :func:`retworkx.unweighted_average_shortest_path_length` for computing
    the average shortest path length of a :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` or
    :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` object. The average shortest path length
    is defined as

    .. math::

        a =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{d(s, t)}{n(n-1)}

    where :math:`V` is the set of nodes in the graph, :math:`d(s, t)` is the
    shortest path length from :math:`s` to :math:`t`, and :math:`n` is the
    number of nodes in graph.
