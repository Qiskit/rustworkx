    Added a new method, :meth:`~retwork.PyGraph.to_directed`, to the
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` class. This method is used to generate a new
    :class:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph` directed graph object from an undirected
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` object. The output :class:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph`
    object will have a bidirectional edge pair for each edge in the original
    :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` object.
