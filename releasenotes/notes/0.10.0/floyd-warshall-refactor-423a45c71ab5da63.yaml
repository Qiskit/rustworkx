features:
  - |
    The :func:`~retworkx.floyd_warshall` function has been completely reworked
    and now works with a :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` object in addition to the
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` objects already supported. It has a new kwarg
    ``weight_fn`` which is used to support custom edge weighting, and also
    now executes in parallel.
  - |
    Added two new functions, :func:`~retworkx.graph_floyd_warshall` and
    :func:`~retworkx.digraph_floyd_warshall`, which are typed versions of the
    existing :func:`~retworkx.floyd_warshall`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :func:`~retworkx.floyd_warshall` function no longer returns a ``dict``
    and instead will return a :class:`retworkx.AllPairsPathLengthMapping`
    object. This new return type is much faster to build and it implements the
    Python mapping protocol in a read-only fashion. This change should mostly
    be compatible unless explicit type checking or mutating the output was
    done.
