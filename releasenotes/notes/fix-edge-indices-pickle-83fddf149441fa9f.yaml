    Fixed an issue when using ``copy.deepcopy()`` on :class:`~.PyDiGraph` and
    :class:`~.PyGraph` objects when there were removed edges from the graph
    object. Previously, if there were any holes in the edge indices caused by
    the removal the output copy of the graph object would incorrectly have
    flatten the indices. This has been corrected so that the edge indices are
    recreated exactly after a ``deepcopy()``.
    Fixed `#585 <https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/issues/585>`__
