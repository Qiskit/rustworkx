    The optional dependencies for :func:`~rustworkx.visualization.graphviz_draw`
    (as documented by the ``graphviz`` optional extra, which can be installed
    via ``pip install rustworkx[graphviz]``) no longer requires the ``pydot``
    library. Only the ``pillow`` library is needed now to generate visualizations
    using graphviz.
