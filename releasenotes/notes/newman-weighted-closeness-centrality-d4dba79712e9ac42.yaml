    Added a new function, :func:`~.newman_weighted_closeness_centrality` to compute the
    closeness centrality of all nodes in a weighted :class:`~.PyGraph` or
    :class:`~.PyDiGraph` object.

    The weighted closeness centrality is an extension of the standard closeness
    centrality measure where edge weights represent connection strength rather
    than distance. To properly compute shortest paths, weights are inverted
    so that stronger connections correspond to shorter effective distances.
    The algorithm follows the method described by Newman (2001) in analyzing
    weighted graphs.

    The edges originally represent connection strength between nodes.
    The idea is that if two nodes have a strong connection, the computed
    distance between them should be small (shorter), and vice versa.
    Note that this assume that the graph is modelling a measure of
    connection strength (e.g. trust, collaboration, or similarity).
