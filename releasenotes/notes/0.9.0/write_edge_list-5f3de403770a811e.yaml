    A new method, :meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.write_edge_list`, has been added
    to the :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph`
    (:meth:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph.write_edge_list`) classes. This method is
    used to write an edge list file representing the graph object. The output
    format is such that it can be used as an input to
    :meth:`rustworkx.PyDiGraph.read_edge_list` and
    :meth:`rustworkx.PyGraph.read_edge_list`.
