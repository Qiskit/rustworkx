  This release is a bugfix release that fixes some issues found since the 0.10.1
  release. The fixes in this release are primarily in the vf2 implementation
  and most importantly fixes the output of :func:`~retworkx.vf2_mapping` with
  an empty input graph and the output of :func:`~retworkx.vf2_mapping`,
  :func:`~retworkx.is_isomorphic`, and :func:`~retworkx.is_subgraph_isomorphic`
  with graphs that have parallel edges.
