    This release includes several new features and bug fixes. The main features
    for this release are some usability improvements including the introduction
    of new methods for interacting with edges, constructing graphs from
    adjacency matrices, and `universal-functions` that are not strictly
    typed and will work with either a :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` or
    :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` object. It also includes new algorithm
    functions around matchings for a :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph`, including a
    function to find the maximum weight matching.

    This is also the first release to include support and publishing of
    precompiled binaries for Apple Arm CPUs on MacOS.
