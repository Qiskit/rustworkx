  This is a new feature release of Rustworkx that adds a many new features to
  the library. The highlights of this release are:

    * An expansion of functions in rustworkx-core that previously only existed
      in the Python API.
    * Expanded graph coloring algorithms

  This release moves to using the `Python Stable ABI <https://docs.python.org/3.9/c-api/stable.html>`__,
  while this release officially supports Python 3.8 through 3.12, the published
  binaries should be compatible with future Python versions too. Although there
  is no guarantee provided about future versions. Additionally, the minimum
  supported Rust version for building rustworkx and more importantly
  rustworkx-core is now 1.70.0. Additionally, in this release the macOS arm64
  platform has been promoted from :ref:`tier-4` to :ref:`tier-1`.
