    The algorithm used for the :func:`~rustworkx.steiner_tree` implementation
    has been replaced by a faster algorithm based on:
    https://doi.org/10.1016/0020-0190(88)90066-X. This new implementation
    achieves the same approximation ratio as the algorithm used previously,
    so there should be no change in functionality.
