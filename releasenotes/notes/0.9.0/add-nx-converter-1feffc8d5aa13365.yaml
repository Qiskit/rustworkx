    A new function :func:`rustworkx.networkx_converter` has been added. This
    function takes in a networkx ``Graph`` object and will generate an
    equivalent :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` or :class:`~rustworkx.PyDiGraph`
    object. While this function is provided as a convience for users of
    both rustworkx and networkx, networkx will **not** be added as a dependency
    of rustworkx (which precludes a rustworkx->networkx converter, see
    :ref:`networkx_converter` for example code on how to build this yourself).
