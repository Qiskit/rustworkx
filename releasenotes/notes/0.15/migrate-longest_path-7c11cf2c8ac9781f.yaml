    Added a new module ``dag_algo`` to rustworkx-core which contains a new function ``longest_path``
    function to rustworkx-core. Previously the :func:`~.longest_path` functionality for DAGs was only exposed
    via the Python interface. Now Rust users can take advantage of this functionality in rustworkx-core.
